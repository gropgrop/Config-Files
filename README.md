# Config-Files
UPDATE - THIS IS NOW DEPRACATED AND PRETTY MUCH ALL ABANDONED.

I learned a ton from this first run, but I've started over from scratch. If you steal any config stuff from this, I can almost guarantee it's gonna not gonna be fun to get working.

Soon, I will be creating a new repo with my dotfiles which focus on deployability.
